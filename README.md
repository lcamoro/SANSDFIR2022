Using Threat Intelligence within Google Colaboratory Notebooks

Threat Intelligence is essential part of most analysis and investigations. You see a suspicious IP address in your logs and you want to check its reputation:

- Is it a known C2 (Command and Control) address? 
- Is it associated with malware? 
- You want to check a file hash to see if it is known malware.  

In many cases, getting a confirmation that your suspected IoC (indicator of compromise) is known to be bad can shortcut hours of investigation time.
